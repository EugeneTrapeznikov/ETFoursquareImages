ETFoursquareImages
==================

When you scroll, image's shown area will become bigger. Like it appears on places' page in Foursquare app.

![example](https://raw.github.com/EugeneTrapeznikov/ETFoursquareImages/master/demo_source/demo.gif)

Requirements
------------

- Xcode 5.
- iOS 6 or later.
- ARC.

How to use
=======================

`ETFoursquareImages` is a simple `UIScrollView` with images on the top of this `UIScrollView`.

Include the `ETFoursquareImages.h` and `ETFoursquareImages.m` in your project.

To display  `ETFoursquareImages`, simply do it like basic `UIVIew`'s `initWithFrame`:

    ETFoursquareImages *foursquareImages = [[ETFoursquareImages alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, self.view.frame.size.height)];
    [self.view addSubview:foursquareImages];

Then you should set images' height and images array. I recommend you to set image's height about 160 pixels:

    int imagesHeight = 160;
    [foursquareImages setImagesHeight:imagesHeight];
    NSArray *images  = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:[UIImage imageNamed:@"horses"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"surfer"], [UIImage imageNamed:@"bridge"], nil];
    [foursquareImages setImages:images];

When you add subview or set scrollView's content size don't forget about images height.

    UITextView *hintTextView = [[UITextView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, imagesHeight+10, 320, 110)];
    hintTextView.text = @"When you scroll, image's shown area will become bigger. Like it appears on place's page in Foursquare app.";
    [foursquareImages.scrollView addSubview:hintTextView];
    
    foursquareImages.scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(320, 110+imagesHeight);

You can adapt scroll view, page control and and view below images (`bottomView`) through this variables:

    @property (nonatomic, strong) UIPageControl *pageControl;
    @property (nonatomic) int pageControlHeight;

    @property (nonatomic, strong) UIScrollView *scrollView;
    @property (nonatomic, strong) UIView *bottomView;
